# MUPIN website prototype

This project represents an attempt at building the Backend/Frontend infrastructure for managing the Piedmontese computer history museum (MUPIN).

The focus of the project was the Backend, hence the very dry approach to UI/UX.

The project's core is [SimpleMVC](https://github.com/simplemvc/skeleton), a PHP framework that uses [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org/) as its DI container and [Plates](https://platesphp.com/) as its template engine.
It also adopts [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) interfaces for HTTP request/response.
